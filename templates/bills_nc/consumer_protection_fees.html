<h2 id="section-1-title">SECTION 1. TITLE.</h2>
<p>This act shall be known as the <strong>“North Carolina Junk Fee and Subscription Fairness Act.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-2-legislative-findings-and-purpose">SECTION 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h2>
<p>The General Assembly finds that:
1. Consumers are often presented with an initial advertised price that does not include unavoidable charges that are added later in the transaction (“junk fees” and “drip pricing”), impairing consumers’ ability to comparison shop.
2. Consumers are frequently enrolled in recurring charges through free-to-pay conversions, misleading interface designs, or disclosures that are not clear and conspicuous, and are then subjected to unreasonable barriers to cancellation (“subscription traps”).
3. Honest businesses that disclose total prices upfront are disadvantaged by competitors that rely on hidden mandatory fees and subscription traps.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purposes of this act are to:
1. Require upfront disclosure of the <strong>total price</strong> a consumer must pay, inclusive of mandatory fees.
2. Prohibit deceptive fee practices and “drip pricing.”
3. Require <strong>express, informed affirmative consent</strong> before any recurring charge begins.
4. Ensure consumers can cancel recurring charges <strong>as easily as they can sign up</strong>.
5. Provide strong enforcement tools and remedies to deter violations and return money to consumers.</p>

<h2 id="75-__-prohibition-on-hidden-mandatory-fees-total-price-transparency"><strong>§ 75-__. Prohibition on hidden mandatory fees; total price transparency.</strong></h2>
<p>(a) <strong>Total price required.</strong> A covered business shall not advertise, display, or represent a price to a consumer unless the <strong>total price</strong> is disclosed clearly and conspicuously at the first time the price is presented.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>No drip pricing at checkout.</strong> A covered business shall not disclose, add, or increase a mandatory fee only after the consumer has:
1. taken substantial steps in the purchasing process; or
2. provided personal information; or
3. provided payment information,
unless the total price (including such mandatory fee) was already disclosed clearly and conspicuously.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Itemization permitted, not a substitute.</strong> A covered business may itemize fees and charges, but itemization does not satisfy this section unless the consumer is also shown the total price clearly and conspicuously.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Truthful description of fees.</strong> A covered business shall not mislabel a mandatory fee as “optional,” “government,” “regulatory,” “processing,” “service,” or similar if the label is false or misleading.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Reasonable good-faith estimates.</strong> For fees that cannot be determined in advance with precision due to consumer-selected variables, the covered business shall disclose:
1. a good-faith estimated range or calculation method,
2. the maximum total price the consumer may pay based on the selected variables, and
3. the earliest point at which the final total price can be determined.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="75-__-subscription-disclosures-affirmative-consent"><strong>§ 75-__. Subscription disclosures; affirmative consent.</strong></h2>
<p>(a) <strong>Disclosure before enrollment.</strong> Before obtaining a consumer’s billing information or charging a consumer for a subscription, a covered business shall disclose clearly and conspicuously:
1. that the consumer is agreeing to a subscription or recurring charge;
2. the amount and frequency of all recurring charges (including any variable components and how they are calculated);
3. the date the recurring charges begin, including the end date of any free trial or discount period;
4. how the consumer may cancel, including the specific method(s) available; and
5. whether any price will increase, and if known, the amount and effective date.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Affirmative express consent required.</strong> A covered business shall not enroll a consumer in a subscription unless the consumer provides <strong>affirmative express consent</strong> to the subscription terms. Silence, inaction, prechecked boxes, or acceptance of general terms that do not specifically obtain consent to the recurring charges shall not constitute affirmative express consent.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Acknowledgment and receipt.</strong> After enrollment, a covered business shall provide the consumer an acknowledgment capable of being retained by the consumer, including:
1. the subscription terms disclosed under subsection (a),
2. the cancellation methods and instructions,
3. a customer service contact method, and
4. confirmation of the consumer’s affirmative consent.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Free-to-pay conversion reminder.</strong> For a free-to-pay conversion, a covered business shall send a reminder notice clearly and conspicuously stating the conversion date and price, and how to cancel, no fewer than <strong>3 days</strong> and no more than <strong>10 days</strong> before the first paid charge, unless the consumer affirmatively elects not to receive such reminder.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="75-__-simple-cancellation-no-unreasonable-barriers"><strong>§ 75-__. Simple cancellation; no unreasonable barriers.</strong></h2>
<p>(a) <strong>Cancellation must be as easy as signup.</strong> A covered business shall provide a cancellation mechanism that is at least as easy to use as the mechanism by which the consumer enrolled.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Online cancellation required when enrolled online.</strong> If a consumer enrolls in a subscription online, the covered business shall permit the consumer to cancel online, using a readily accessible method that does not require:
1. calling by telephone,
2. live chat with an agent,
3. navigating through more than one screen after accessing the cancellation function, or
4. providing information not reasonably necessary to identify the account.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Immediate confirmation.</strong> Upon cancellation, the covered business shall:
1. provide immediate confirmation on-screen (if cancellation occurs online), and
2. send a confirmation to the consumer in a retainable form (email, text, or other method chosen by the consumer), stating the effective date of cancellation and any remaining charges authorized.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>No “save” screens that block cancellation.</strong> A covered business may present a retention offer during cancellation only if:
1. the option to complete cancellation is displayed <strong>simultaneously</strong> and as prominently as the retention offer; and
2. the consumer can complete cancellation without additional obstacles.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>No post-cancellation charges.</strong> A covered business shall not charge a consumer after the effective cancellation date, except for charges that were clearly disclosed and expressly authorized for a specific remaining term.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="75-__-renewal-reminders-for-long-term-subscriptions"><strong>§ 75-__. Renewal reminders for long-term subscriptions.</strong></h2>
<p>For any subscription with a term of <strong>12 months or longer</strong>, or that automatically renews for a term of <strong>12 months or longer</strong>, the covered business shall provide a renewal reminder notice clearly and conspicuously stating the renewal date, renewal price, and cancellation method, delivered no fewer than <strong>15 days</strong> and no more than <strong>45 days</strong> before renewal.</p>

<h2 id="75-__-enforcement-remedies-relationship-to-other-law"><strong>§ 75-__. Enforcement; remedies; relationship to other law.</strong></h2>

<p>(d) <strong>Private right of action not limited.</strong> Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit any private right of action or remedy otherwise available under Chapter 75.</p>

<p>Notes on “prior art” this draft is modeled on (for your reference)</p>
<p>NYC’s Executive Order 09 framework on hidden junk fees and enforcement coordination. 
New York City Government</p>
<p>North Carolina’s general UDTPA framework (G.S. 75-1.1) and remedies/penalties commonly used for consumer protection enforcement (including civil penalties up to $5,000 per violation under G.S. 75-15.2 and private remedies under G.S. 75-16 / attorneys’ fees under G.S. 75-16.1).
