<h2 id="whereas">Whereas</h2>
<ol>
<li>Free and fair elections require electoral districts that reflect communities and geography rather than political advantage; and  </li>
<li>Clear, neutral, testable standards—combined with transparency and enforceable prohibitions—reduce the risk of partisan gerrymandering; and  </li>
<li><strong>Experience in multiple jurisdictions demonstrates that commissions and bipartisan committees may fail to timely agree on maps</strong>, resulting in delay and litigation; and  </li>
<li>Advances in public mapping tools and open methods now permit a practical, reproducible process centered on <strong>geometry, objective metrics, and publicly auditable computation</strong>; and  </li>
<li>For these reasons, the State’s district boundaries must be produced by <strong>a non-discretionary, rule-bound geometric method</strong>, not by negotiation, compromise “line edits,” or human design by committee.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now, therefore,</strong> The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="part-i-definitions-and-purpose">PART I. DEFINITIONS AND PURPOSE</h1>
<h2 id="section-1-short-title">SECTION 1. Short Title.</h2>
<p>This act shall be known as the <strong>“Geometric Fair Districts Act.”</strong></p>
<h2 id="section-2-definitions">SECTION 2. Definitions.</h2>
<p>For purposes of this act:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“Commission”</strong> means the North Carolina Geometric Redistricting Commission established in Part II.  </li>
<li><strong>“Technical Unit”</strong> means the nonpartisan technical staff described in Section 6.  </li>
<li><strong>“Algorithmic Geometric Plan”</strong> means a districting plan produced solely by the Geometry-First Method required by Section 10, using only permitted inputs, with no post-generation manual boundary edits.  </li>
<li><strong>“Districting plan”</strong> means a full set of districts for one elected body (North Carolina House of Representatives, North Carolina Senate, or North Carolina’s districts for the United States House of Representatives).  </li>
<li><strong>“Geometry-first”</strong> means generated and evaluated primarily using geographic and census population data, contiguity, compactness measures, and political-subdivision boundaries, and <strong>not</strong> using partisan, incumbent, or candidate data, except as expressly permitted for compliance review under State and federal law.  </li>
<li><strong>“Political data”</strong> means party registration, past election results, partisan indexes, modeled partisanship, incumbents’ addresses, candidates’ addresses, and any data derived from those items.  </li>
<li><strong>“Compactness metrics”</strong> include, at minimum:</li>
<li>a. <strong>Cut-Edges Compactness</strong> (graph-based boundary complexity),  </li>
<li>b. <strong>Reock Compactness</strong>, and  </li>
<li>c. <strong>Polsby–Popper Compactness</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>“Outlier analysis”</strong> means a statistical evaluation comparing a proposed plan to a large ensemble of alternative plans generated without political data, to determine whether the proposed plan is an extreme outlier with respect to partisan outcomes or other plan-level measures, consistent with the limitations and prohibitions in this act.  </li>
<li><strong>“VRA”</strong> means the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, including Section 2, and any controlling federal judicial interpretations.  </li>
<li><strong>“Manual boundary edit”</strong> means any human-directed adjustment that changes which census blocks, precincts, or other geographic units are assigned to districts <strong>after</strong> a candidate plan has been generated by the Geometry-First Method, excluding only (i) correction of clerical/formatting errors in published descriptions, or (ii) replacement of an input dataset with a corrected version and <strong>rerun</strong> of the method.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3-purpose">SECTION 3. Purpose.</h2>
<p>The purposes of this act are to:
1. Produce districts that are <strong>neutral, compact, contiguous, population-balanced, and transparent</strong>;<br />
2. Make gerrymandering practically difficult by requiring a <strong>reproducible, geometry-first, algorithmic plan-generation method</strong>;<br />
3. Prevent deadlock and bargaining by requiring <strong>automatic, non-discretionary plan selection</strong> and by prohibiting human “committee line-drawing”; and<br />
4. Provide enforceable guardrails, including <strong>prohibitions on partisan favoritism</strong>, public disclosure, and objective metrics-based review prior to adoption.</p>

<li>b. an initial <strong>splitline-style partitioning</strong> step that uses straight-line or shortest-boundary splits to create compact components; and  </li>
<li>c. an optimization step that selects best plans under Section 11 scoring, subject to Sections 7–9 constraints.  </li>
<li><strong>No Manual Boundary Edits.</strong> After any candidate plan is generated, no Commission member or staff may alter district boundaries by hand. If a legal defect is identified, the remedy shall be limited to:</li>
<li>a. correcting the input dataset (if erroneous) and rerunning; and/or  </li>
<li>b. adding or tightening <strong>objective constraints</strong> required for compliance (e.g., VRA constraints) and rerunning; and/or  </li>
<li>c. selecting the next-highest-scoring compliant plan produced by the Method.  </li>

<li>Before finalizing any plan, the Commission shall obtain an independent outlier analysis performed by:</li>
<li>a. a third-party consultant selected through a transparent process, or  </li>
<li>b. a qualified academic or public-interest institution with demonstrated expertise.  </li>
<li>The outlier analysis shall:</li>
<li>a. generate an ensemble of alternative plans meeting Sections 7–9 using no political data in construction;  </li>
<li>b. compare the selected plan to the ensemble; and  </li>
<li>c. determine whether the selected plan is an <strong>extreme outlier</strong> with respect to partisan outcomes and any other metrics the Commission adopts by rule.  </li>
<li><strong>Restriction.</strong> If the selected plan is found to be an extreme outlier favoring a party, the Technical Unit shall:</li>
<li>a. publish that finding; and  </li>
<li>b. select the next-best compliant plan under Section 15, unless deviation is necessary to comply with Section 7(1), in which case the Technical Unit shall publish written findings explaining the necessity.</li>

<h2 id="section-19-constitutional-amendment">SECTION 19. Constitutional Amendment.</h2>
<ol>
<li>The General Assembly proposes to the qualified voters of North Carolina an amendment to the North Carolina Constitution to authorize and require an independent redistricting process consistent with this act, transferring primary map-effectiveness authority for legislative and congressional districting from the General Assembly to the <strong>Algorithmic Geometric Plan process</strong>, subject to judicial review.  </li>
<li>The amendment shall be submitted at the next statewide general election in accordance with Article XIII of the North Carolina Constitution.  </li>
<li>The ballot question shall read substantially as follows:  <blockquote>
<p><strong>“Constitutional amendment to require an open, reproducible, geometry-first algorithm to draw legislative and congressional districts and to prohibit partisan gerrymandering and committee line-drawing.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-20-contingent-effect">SECTION 20. Contingent Effect.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Parts II–V of this act shall become fully operative upon certification that the constitutional amendment in Section 19 has been approved by the voters.  </li>
<li>If the amendment is not approved, Parts III–V shall remain as <strong>mandatory statutory criteria and transparency requirements</strong> governing any redistricting undertaken by the General Assembly, to the extent not inconsistent with the Constitution.</li>

<h2 id="section-21-effective-date">SECTION 21. Effective Date.</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided, this act is effective when it becomes law.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h1 id="reference-notes-not-part-of-the-bill">REFERENCE NOTES (NOT PART OF THE BILL)</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>NC “prior art” structure and criteria style:</strong> Your hearing timeline and “no partisan/election-results data in drawing” approach is aligned with the structure/criteria style found in recent NC proposals such as S698 (2025).  </li>
<li><strong>NC “no political considerations” language:</strong> Similar prohibitions on considering election results, party affiliation, and incumbency appear in NC proposals such as H20 (2025).  </li>
<li><strong>Why this bill removes committee line-drawing discretion:</strong> In several states, commissions have failed to agree by deadline, shifting map adoption to courts or special masters; this draft treats that risk as a design constraint and therefore mandates a non-discretionary, algorithmic selection rule.  </li>
<li><strong>Iowa-style “no political data / no favoritism” model reference:</strong> Iowa’s nonpartisan-staff approach is used here as a structural reference for strict data prohibitions and for insulating map generation from political bargaining.  </li>
<li><strong>Compactness concept reference:</strong> Iowa guidance is often summarized as favoring</li>
