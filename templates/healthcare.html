<p>Care should be between doctors and patients. Health care should be about health; not profits. Currently, the system is driven by extracting profits through rent-seeking middle men. Keep health care to find doctors, patients, labs, and research. Not hospital admins, CEOs, and insurance companies. Some bureaucracy is necessary, but we shouldn’t overdo it: Keep healthcare focused on patients, and their interaction with doctors. This may mean increasing the number of doctors as required to maintain a high quality of care.</p>
<h2 id="transparent-healthcare-pricing">Transparent healthcare pricing</h2>
<p>No special deals for insurance companies. Publicly available billing codes. Transparent, itemized receipt. No gouging on Aspirin. No opaque, insane prices. No byzantine bureaucracy This is fraud that directly harms Americans. Fix the CPT system.</p>
<p>US hospital billing is based on the idea that the patient has insurance and won't really care about what their insurer gets charged. </p>
<p>No hidden insurance-company rates and negotiation leaving the uninsured to pay astronomical fees out of pocket, or go into debt.</p>
