<h2 id="section-1-short-title">SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h2>
<p>This Act may be cited as the <strong>“Transparent Pricing and Subscription Fairness Act.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="sec-2-findings-and-purposes">SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h2>
<h3 id="a-findings">(a) Findings.</h3>
<p>Congress finds that—</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumers frequently cannot determine the true total price of goods and services because mandatory fees are hidden or disclosed only late in the transaction (“drip pricing”).</li>
<li>Subscription and “negative option” marketing practices—including free-to-pay conversions and automatic renewals—are often presented in ways that obscure recurring charges or make cancellation unreasonably difficult.</li>
<li>These practices distort competition, disadvantage honest businesses that disclose prices upfront, and impose widespread consumer harm.</li>
<li>Federal law prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and Congress may establish clear nationwide minimum standards to prevent such harms.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-purposes">(b) Purposes.</h3>
<p>The purposes of this Act are—</p>
<ol>
<li>to require <strong>clear, upfront disclosure of total prices</strong> inclusive of mandatory fees;</li>
<li>to prohibit deceptive fee practices and drip pricing;</li>
<li>to require <strong>affirmative express consent</strong> before initiating any recurring charge;</li>
<li>to ensure consumers can <strong>cancel recurring charges as easily as they can sign up</strong>; and</li>
<li>to provide robust federal and State enforcement tools and remedies.</li>
</ol>
