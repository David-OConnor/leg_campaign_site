<h3 id="the-geometric-fair-congressional-districts-act-of-2026">The “Geometric Fair Congressional Districts Act of 2026”.</h3>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-1-short-title">SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h2>
<p>This Act may be cited as the <strong>“Geometric Fair Congressional Districts Act of 2026.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="sec-2-findings-purposes">SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.</h2>
<h3 id="a-findings">(a) Findings.</h3>
<p>Congress finds the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Article I, section 4 of the Constitution grants Congress authority to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections for Representatives.  </li>
<li>The legitimacy of representative government depends on congressional districts that are compact, contiguous, population-balanced, and compliant with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  </li>
<li>Partisan and incumbent-driven redistricting undermines equal representation and public trust.  </li>
<li>Redistricting processes that rely on bipartisan bargaining or multi-member committees can fail to timely produce maps, leading to delay, litigation, or court-imposed plans.  </li>
<li>Modern public mapping tools and open-source methods allow congressional districts to be created through <strong>reproducible, publicly auditable, geometry-based computation</strong> using neutral criteria and without partisan data.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-purposes">(b) Purposes.</h3>
<p>The purposes of this Act are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To mandate a <strong>non-discretionary, geometry-first, algorithmic method</strong> for congressional redistricting that does not depend on political negotiation.  </li>
<li>To prohibit the use of partisan, incumbent, or candidate data in the construction of congressional districts.  </li>
<li>To require transparency, reproducibility, and objective testing (including ensemble outlier analysis) before any congressional map may take effect.  </li>
<li>To prevent deadlock and delay by providing <strong>automatic adoption</strong> and ranked fallback procedures.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h1 id="title-i-definitions">TITLE I — DEFINITIONS</h1>

<p>In this Act:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“State”</strong> means each State of the United States.  </li>
<li><strong>“Covered redistricting”</strong> means the establishment of congressional districts after an apportionment under the decennial census, or any court-ordered redistricting affecting congressional districts.  </li>
<li><strong>“Congressional districting plan”</strong> means a complete set of districts for the election of Representatives in Congress for a State entitled to more than one Representative.  </li>
<li><strong>“Algorithmic Geometric Plan”</strong> means a congressional districting plan produced solely by the Geometry-First Method required by section 301, using only permitted inputs, with no post-generation manual boundary edits.  </li>
<li><strong>“Geometry-First Method”</strong> means the mandated plan-generation process described in section 301.  </li>
<li><strong>“Political data”</strong> means party registration, past election results, partisan indexes, modeled partisanship, incumbents’ addresses, candidates’ addresses, and any data derived from those items.  </li>
<li><strong>“Manual boundary edit”</strong> means any human-directed adjustment that changes which census blocks, voting precincts, or other geographic units are assigned to districts after a candidate plan has been generated by the Geometry-First Method, excluding only (A) clerical corrections that do not change assignments, or (B) correction of an input dataset followed by a complete rerun of the Method.  </li>
