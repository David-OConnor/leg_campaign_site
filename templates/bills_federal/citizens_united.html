<h1 id="h-r-____">H. R. ____</h1>
<h2 id="a-bill">A BILL</h2>
<p>To clarify that campaign finance and the expenditure of money to influence elections are not speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, to restore the authority of Congress and the States to enact reasonable regulation of campaign contributions and expenditures, to establish a system of public financing for Federal elections, and for other purposes.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="be-it-enacted-by-the-senate-and-house-of-representatives-of-the-united-states-of-america-in-congress-assembled">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</h2>
<h3 id="section-1-short-title">SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<p>This Act may be cited as the <strong>“Democracy Not For Sale Act.”</strong></p>
<h3 id="sec-2-findings-and-purposes">SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h3>
<h4 id="a-findings">(a) Findings.</h4>
<p>Congress finds the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The legitimacy of democratic government requires that elections be fair, representative, and free from domination by concentrated wealth.</li>
<li>The raising and spending of money to influence elections can create corruption, the appearance of corruption, and unequal access to elected officials.</li>
<li>Unlimited independent expenditures and closely related practices have enabled a small number of wealthy individuals and entities to exert disproportionate influence over Federal elections.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court’s decisions, including <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), and related precedents, have restricted the ability of Congress and the States to protect electoral integrity and political equality.</li>
<li>Campaign finance is an instrumentality that may facilitate the dissemination of speech, but it is not itself “speech” for purposes of constitutional analysis; regulation of campaign contributions and expenditures is regulation of conduct and the electoral process.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b-purposes">(b) Purposes.</h4>
<p>The purposes of this Act are—</p>
<ol>
<li>to clarify that campaign contributions, expenditures, and the use of money or thing-of-value to influence elections are not speech within the meaning of the First Amendment;</li>
<li>to restore and reaffirm the authority of Congress and the States to enact reasonable limits and safeguards concerning election-related spending and contributions to protect against corruption, the appearance of corruption, and domination by concentrated wealth;</li>
<li>to establish a robust system of public financing for Federal elections so that candidates may run viable campaigns without dependence on large private donors; and</li>
<li>to ensure that democratic self-government is not undermined by the ability of wealthy persons and entities to buy disproportionate influence over electoral outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="sec-3-definitions">SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.</h3>
<p>For purposes of this Act:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Covered election</strong> means any primary, general, special, or runoff election for Federal office.</li>
<li><strong>Federal office</strong> means the office of President, Vice President, Senator, or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Election-related spending</strong> means any contribution, expenditure, independent expenditure, electioneering communication, coordinated communication, or disbursement of money or thing-of-value for the purpose of influencing any covered election.</li>
<li><strong>Thing-of-value</strong> has the meaning given such term under Federal election law and includes in-kind contributions, goods, services, and anything of ascertainable monetary value.</li>
<li><strong>Large contribution</strong> means any contribution above a threshold established by the Federal Election Commission pursuant to this Act, which threshold shall be substantially lower than historical contribution limits in order to prevent circumvention and domination by wealth.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="sec-4-declaration-of-policy-campaign-finance-is-not-free-speech">SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF POLICY: CAMPAIGN FINANCE IS NOT FREE SPEECH.</h3>
<h4 id="a-rule-of-construction">(a) Rule of construction.</h4>
<p>It is the sense of Congress and the declared policy of the United States that—</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>campaign finance is not speech</strong>, and the expenditure of money or thing-of-value to influence elections is not “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment; and</li>
<li>the First Amendment protects the right of persons to speak, publish, assemble, petition, and associate, but does not require government to treat the spending of money to influence elections as constitutionally equivalent to speech itself.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b-regulation-of-electoral-conduct">(b) Regulation of electoral conduct.</h4>
<p>Election-related spending constitutes conduct that may be regulated to protect electoral integrity, political equality, and democratic self-government, including by limits on contributions and expenditures, disclosure, anti-circumvention provisions, and restrictions on the use of corporate and other artificial-entity funds.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sec-5-restoration-of-regulatory-authority-overruling-of-certain-precedents-statutory">SEC. 5. RESTORATION OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY; OVERRULING OF CERTAIN PRECEDENTS (STATUTORY).</h3>
<h4 id="a-restoration-of-authority">(a) Restoration of authority.</h4>
<p>Congress declares that it has authority under Article I, section 4; Article I, section 8; the Necessary and Proper Clause; and the enforcement clauses of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, to enact reasonable regulation of election-related spending in covered elections.</p>
<h4 id="b-statutory-override-intent">(b) Statutory override; intent.</h4>
<p>It is the intent of Congress that, in interpreting Federal election statutes and this Act, courts shall not construe the First Amendment to prohibit Congress from—</p>
<ol>
<li>setting reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures related to covered elections;</li>
<li>restricting or prohibiting independent expenditures by corporations, labor organizations, and other artificial entities;</li>
<li>regulating coordinated spending, electioneering communications, and functional equivalents of express advocacy;</li>
<li>enacting strong disclosure, disclaimer, and transparency requirements; and</li>
<li>preventing circumvention through intermediaries, shell entities, pass-through organizations, and similar mechanisms.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="c-severability-of-constitutional-questions">(c) Severability of constitutional questions.</h4>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit Congress from proposing, and the States from ratifying, a constitutional amendment to further clarify these principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This section states congressional intent and directs statutory interpretation. If enacted alone, it cannot by itself “invalidate” a Supreme Court constitutional holding; accomplishing that definitively requires a constitutional amendment. The public-financing and regulatory provisions below can be enacted by statute, but overruling <em>Citizens United</em> as constitutional precedent requires an amendment or later Supreme Court reversal.</p>
