<h1 id="funding-for-science">Funding for science</h1>
<p>I support funding basic research - without a requirement for short-term payoffs, and without 
wasting researcher's times on competing for grants in a 0-sum game.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-literacy">Scientific literacy</h2>
<p>I support encouraging scientific literacy from a young age. A scientifically-literate person is better-equipped to make informed decisions, and separate valid from invalid claims.</p>
<p>Citizens equipped with a sensitive, accurate BS-detection kit is a robust defense against authoritarianism.</p>
<h2 id="a-role-model-as-we-were">A role model, as we were</h2>
<p>We will regain our status as a role model for scientific research; attracting top talent 
from around the world, and nurturing science in our children.</p>
