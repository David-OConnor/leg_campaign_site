<h1 id="affordable-housing">Affordable housing</h1>
<p>Affordable housing is the backbone of thriving towns and cities. Supporting zoning laws, and tax breaks for occupied
housing units. The median first-time homebuyer age in America is now forty years old. We are pricing younger generations out of home-ownership. By the end of a typical 30-year mortgage, the majority of the money spent by homeowners simply goes to the lender. </p>
<p>The accelerating financialization of real estate hurts the younger generation who aspire to be homeowners, or afford rent. </p>
<p>I support NC locals who live in their houses as a priority over short-term rentals and homes bought by corporations to turn a profit.</p>
<h2 id="new-construction">New construction</h2>
<p>As the NC population grows, housing growth has failed to match that.Encourage building more housing, and make compliant with code and regulations transparent. I will fight for this in Wake County, and all of North Carolina. </p>
<h2 id="houses-for-living-not-investments">Houses for living; not investments</h2>
<p>Treat homes as housing: Not as an investment vehicle or way for private equity and REITs to enrich themselves. I will submit and vote for legislation that makes it easier to build new housing, and support policies that incentivize lived-in homes, vs vacant ones. Discourage housing as investment vehicles. When housing sits idle as people struggle to make money, we have a conflict.</p>
<p>Residents who aren’t spending most of their income on rent improves our local and state economies, and lets people focus on what’s important in their life: Not how to afford rent.</p>
