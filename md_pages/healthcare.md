## Affordable healthcare for all
Care should be between doctors and patients. Health care should be about health; not profits. Our current system is driven by rent-seeking middle men. Making CEOs wealthy, generating shareholder value and extracting value at all costs: These are at odds with patient care, and medical innovation. 

Health care must be driven by doctors, patients, labs, and researchers. Not hospital admins, CEOs, and insurance companies. Some bureaucracy is necessary, but we've gone far past that. This means increasing the number of doctors as required to maintain a high quality of care. Funding competition, and removing rent-seeking parasties.


## Transparent healthcare pricing
No special deals for insurance companies. Publicly available billing codes. Transparent, itemized receipt. No gouging on Aspirin. No opaque, insane prices. No byzantine bureaucracy This is fraud that directly harms Americans. Fix the CPT system.

US hospital billing is based on the idea that the patient has insurance and won't really care about what their insurer gets charged. 

No hidden insurance-company rates and negotiation leaving the uninsured to pay astronomical fees out of pocket, or go into debt.
