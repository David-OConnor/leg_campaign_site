## Affordable housing

Affordable housing is the backbone of thriving towns and cities. Supporting zoning laws, and tax breaks for occupied housing units. 

Discourage housing as investment vehicles. When housing sits idle as people struggle to make money, we have a conflict. Housing is a basic right. Encourage building more housing, and make compliant with code and regulations transparent. Discourage rent-seeking.

People who aren’t spending most of their income on rent improves our local and state economies, and lets people focus on what’s important in their life: Not how to afford rent.
