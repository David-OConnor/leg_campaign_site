# Affordable housing

Affordable housing is the backbone of thriving towns and cities. Supporting zoning laws, and tax breaks for occupied housing units. The median first-time homebuyer age in America is now forty years old. We are pricing younger generations out of home-ownership. By the end of a typical 30-year mortgage, the majority of the money spent by homeowners simply goes to the lender. 

The accelerating financialization of real estate hurts the younger generation who aspire to be homeowners, or afford rent. 

I support NC locals who live in their houses as a priority over short-term rentals and homes bought by corporations to turn a profit.


## New construction
As the NC population grows, housing growth has failed to match that.Encourage building more housing, and make compliant with code and regulations transparent. I will fight for this in Wake County, and all of North Carolina. 


## Houses for living; not investments

Treat homes as housing: Not as an investment vehicle or way for private equity and REITs to enrich themselves. I will submit and vote for legislation that makes it easier to build new housing, and support policies that incentivize lived-in homes, vs vacant ones. Discourage housing as investment vehicles. When housing sits idle as people struggle to make money, we have a conflict.

Residents who aren’t spending most of their income on rent improves our local and state economies, and lets people focus on what’s important in their life: Not how to afford rent.
