# Democratic reform

A fair election system is critical to a healthy democracy, and is a foundation to everything else in politics. Our current system strongly favors incumant candidates, at the expense of representation of the people.


## Gerrymandering
There is no conscionable justification for our Gerrymandered electoral districts, and it's embarrasing that we haven't fixed them. Continuing to promote these, even if it means a win for your team, is unethical, and is the root of other problems we face.

We cannot allow the people who are elected to determine the election boundaries. This is an inherrantly unfair system with misaligned incentives. Use system with districts that aren't hand-selected to benefit specific parties or candidates

### Legislation
When elected, I will continue to press for this as a top priority, and will continue to draft and promote legislation that provides a practical path forward on this. I support NC [HR20: Establishing the Select Committee on Electoral Reform]((https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/20/text?s=1&r=5&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22election+reform%22%7D))

- Fix our districts. Gerrymandered districts run counter to the most basic principles of democracy.  Fix them: There is no valid justification for keeping them. This is a truly bipartisan problem, and shows that we’re serious about democracy, and fighting corruption. Our current districts are an embarrassment.

We don’t need a perfect solution, and there are many viable options. I propose ____, but would support any system based on geometry. Fair maps mean politicians are truly representatives of the people, instead of their own interests.
