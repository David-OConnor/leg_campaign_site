### IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Mr./Ms. __________________ introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on __________________

---

## A BILL  
### Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

---

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the **“Transparent Pricing and Subscription Fairness Act.”**

---

## SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

### (a) Findings.
Congress finds that—

1. Consumers frequently cannot determine the true total price of goods and services because mandatory fees are hidden or disclosed only late in the transaction (“drip pricing”).
2. Subscription and “negative option” marketing practices—including free-to-pay conversions and automatic renewals—are often presented in ways that obscure recurring charges or make cancellation unreasonably difficult.
3. These practices distort competition, disadvantage honest businesses that disclose prices upfront, and impose widespread consumer harm.
4. Federal law prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and Congress may establish clear nationwide minimum standards to prevent such harms.

### (b) Purposes.
The purposes of this Act are—

1. to require **clear, upfront disclosure of total prices** inclusive of mandatory fees;
2. to prohibit deceptive fee practices and drip pricing;
3. to require **affirmative express consent** before initiating any recurring charge;
4. to ensure consumers can **cancel recurring charges as easily as they can sign up**; and
5. to provide robust federal and State enforcement tools and remedies.

# TITLE I — TRANSPARENT PRICING AND JUNK FEE PREVENTION

## SEC. 101. UPFRONT TOTAL-PRICE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.
### (a) Requirement.
It shall be unlawful for a covered entity to advertise, display, or represent a price to a consumer unless the **total price** is disclosed **clearly and conspicuously** at the first time the price is presented.

### (b) No drip pricing.
It shall be unlawful for a covered entity to disclose, add, or increase any mandatory fee only after the consumer has—

1. taken substantial steps in the purchasing process; or
2. provided personal information; or
3. provided payment information,  

unless the total price (including such mandatory fee) was already disclosed clearly and conspicuously.

### (c) Itemization permitted; not a substitute.
A covered entity may itemize fees and charges, but itemization does not satisfy subsection (a) unless the covered entity also displays the total price clearly and conspicuously and at least as prominently as any other price information.

### (d) Truthful labeling.
It shall be unlawful to misrepresent the nature of any fee, including by labeling a mandatory fee as “optional,” “government,” “regulatory,” “processing,” “service,” or similar if such label is false or misleading.

### (e) Variable fees; good-faith estimates.
If the total price cannot be determined with precision at the first time the price is presented due to consumer-selected variables, the covered entity shall disclose clearly and conspicuously—

1. a good-faith estimated range or the method of calculation;
2. the maximum total price based on the variables selected; and
3. the earliest point at which the final total price can be determined.

---

## SEC. 102. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION; NO LIMITATION ON HONEST DISCOUNTS.
Nothing in this Title shall be construed to prohibit a covered entity from offering discounts, promotions, or optional add-ons, provided the total price for the selected good or service (inclusive of mandatory fees) is disclosed clearly and conspicuously as required by this Title.

# TITLE II — SUBSCRIPTION AND NEGATIVE OPTION FAIRNESS

## SEC. 201. MATERIAL DISCLOSURES BEFORE ENROLLMENT.

2. the amount and frequency of all recurring charges (including any variable components and how they are calculated);
3. the date recurring charges begin, including the end date of any free trial or discount period;
4. how the consumer may cancel, including all available methods; and

## SEC. 202. AFFIRMATIVE EXPRESS CONSENT REQUIRED.
### (a) Consent.
It shall be unlawful to enroll a consumer in a subscription unless the consumer provides **affirmative express consent** to the subscription terms.

### (b) Invalid “consent” mechanisms.
The following shall not constitute affirmative express consent:

1. prechecked boxes;
2. acceptance of general terms that do not specifically obtain consent to the recurring charge; or
3. silence, inaction, or failure to cancel a free trial absent compliant disclosures under section 201 and an affirmative act indicating agreement to the paid subscription.

---

## SEC. 203. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND RECEIPT.
After enrollment, a covered entity shall provide the consumer, in a form the consumer can retain—

1. a summary of the subscription terms disclosed under section 201;

4. confirmation of the consumer’s affirmative express consent.

---

## SEC. 204. FREE-TO-PAY CONVERSION REMINDER.
For any free-to-pay conversion, a covered entity shall provide a reminder notice that is clear and conspicuous and that states the conversion date, the amount to be charged, and how to cancel. The reminder shall be sent no fewer than **3 days** and no more than **10 days** before the first paid charge, unless the consumer affirmatively opts out of receiving such reminder.

---

## SEC. 205. SIMPLE CANCELLATION (“CLICK TO CANCEL”).
### (a) Cancellation must be as easy as signup.
A covered entity shall provide a cancellation mechanism that is at least as easy to use as the mechanism by which the consumer enrolled.

### (b) Online cancellation required for online enrollment.
If a consumer enrolls online, the covered entity shall permit the consumer to cancel online through a readily accessible method that does not require—

1. calling by telephone;
2. interacting with a live agent via chat as a condition of cancellation; or
3. navigating more than one additional screen after selecting the option to cancel.

### (c) Immediate confirmation.
Upon cancellation, the covered entity shall provide immediate confirmation and shall send the consumer a confirmation in a retainable form stating the effective date of cancellation and any remaining charges authorized under the subscription terms.

### (d) No obstruction by retention offers.
A covered entity may present a retention offer only if the option to complete cancellation is displayed simultaneously and as prominently as the retention offer and the consumer can complete cancellation without additional steps beyond those required to accept the retention offer.

---

## SEC. 206. RENEWAL REMINDERS FOR LONG-TERM SUBSCRIPTIONS.
For any subscription with an initial term of **12 months or longer**, or that automatically renews for a term of **12 months or longer**, a covered entity shall provide a renewal reminder notice no fewer than **15 days** and no more than **45 days** before renewal, stating the renewal date, renewal price, and the methods to cancel.
