## A BILL

## Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the **“Democracy Not For Sale Act.”**

### SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

#### (a) Findings.
Congress finds the following:

1. The legitimacy of democratic government requires that elections be fair, representative, and free from domination by concentrated wealth.
2. The raising and spending of money to influence elections can create corruption, the appearance of corruption, and unequal access to elected officials.
3. Unlimited independent expenditures and closely related practices have enabled a small number of wealthy individuals and entities to exert disproportionate influence over Federal elections.
4. The Supreme Court’s decisions, including *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), and related precedents, have restricted the ability of Congress and the States to protect electoral integrity and political equality.
5. Campaign finance is an instrumentality that may facilitate the dissemination of speech, but it is not itself “speech” for purposes of constitutional analysis; regulation of campaign contributions and expenditures is regulation of conduct and the electoral process.

#### (b) Purposes.
The purposes of this Act are—

1. to clarify that campaign contributions, expenditures, and the use of money or thing-of-value to influence elections are not speech within the meaning of the First Amendment;
2. to restore and reaffirm the authority of Congress and the States to enact reasonable limits and safeguards concerning election-related spending and contributions to protect against corruption, the appearance of corruption, and domination by concentrated wealth;
3. to establish a robust system of public financing for Federal elections so that candidates may run viable campaigns without dependence on large private donors; and
4. to ensure that democratic self-government is not undermined by the ability of wealthy persons and entities to buy disproportionate influence over electoral outcomes.

### SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this Act:

1. **Covered election** means any primary, general, special, or runoff election for Federal office.
2. **Federal office** means the office of President, Vice President, Senator, or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress.
3. **Election-related spending** means any contribution, expenditure, independent expenditure, electioneering communication, coordinated communication, or disbursement of money or thing-of-value for the purpose of influencing any covered election.
4. **Thing-of-value** has the meaning given such term under Federal election law and includes in-kind contributions, goods, services, and anything of ascertainable monetary value.
5. **Large contribution** means any contribution above a threshold established by the Federal Election Commission pursuant to this Act, which threshold shall be substantially lower than historical contribution limits in order to prevent circumvention and domination by wealth.

---

### SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF POLICY: CAMPAIGN FINANCE IS NOT FREE SPEECH.

#### (a) Rule of construction.
It is the sense of Congress and the declared policy of the United States that—

1. **campaign finance is not speech**, and the expenditure of money or thing-of-value to influence elections is not “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment; and
2. the First Amendment protects the right of persons to speak, publish, assemble, petition, and associate, but does not require government to treat the spending of money to influence elections as constitutionally equivalent to speech itself.

#### (b) Regulation of electoral conduct.
Election-related spending constitutes conduct that may be regulated to protect electoral integrity, political equality, and democratic self-government, including by limits on contributions and expenditures, disclosure, anti-circumvention provisions, and restrictions on the use of corporate and other artificial-entity funds.

---

### SEC. 5. RESTORATION OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY; OVERRULING OF CERTAIN PRECEDENTS (STATUTORY).

#### (a) Restoration of authority.
Congress declares that it has authority under Article I, section 4; Article I, section 8; the Necessary and Proper Clause; and the enforcement clauses of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, to enact reasonable regulation of election-related spending in covered elections.

#### (b) Statutory override; intent.
It is the intent of Congress that, in interpreting Federal election statutes and this Act, courts shall not construe the First Amendment to prohibit Congress from—

1. setting reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures related to covered elections;
2. restricting or prohibiting independent expenditures by corporations, labor organizations, and other artificial entities;
3. regulating coordinated spending, electioneering communications, and functional equivalents of express advocacy;
4. enacting strong disclosure, disclaimer, and transparency requirements; and
5. preventing circumvention through intermediaries, shell entities, pass-through organizations, and similar mechanisms.

#### (c) Severability of constitutional questions.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit Congress from proposing, and the States from ratifying, a constitutional amendment to further clarify these principles.

> **Note:** This section states congressional intent and directs statutory interpretation. If enacted alone, it cannot by itself “invalidate” a Supreme Court constitutional holding; accomplishing that definitively requires a constitutional amendment. The public-financing and regulatory provisions below can be enacted by statute, but overruling *Citizens United* as constitutional precedent requires an amendment or later Supreme Court reversal.

### SEC. 6. PUBLIC FINANCING OF FEDERAL ELECTIONS.

#### (a) Establishment.
There is established a program, administered by the Federal Election Commission (the “Commission”), to provide public financing for candidates for Federal office who opt in and agree to comply with program requirements.

#### (b) Eligibility.
A candidate shall be eligible to receive public funds for a covered election if the candidate—

1. demonstrates a threshold of public support through a qualifying number of small-dollar contributions from natural persons who are eligible voters (as determined by the Commission);
2. agrees to abide by strict limits on private contributions and total campaign spending for the covered election, as established by the Commission consistent with this Act;
3. agrees to reject large contributions and to accept only small-dollar contributions below a ceiling set by the Commission; and
4. complies with enhanced transparency, auditing, and reporting requirements.

#### (c) Structure of funding.
Public financing shall include—

1. **Small-donor matching**, under which small-dollar contributions to participating candidates are matched at a multiple determined by the Commission to amplify ordinary voters’ voices; and
2. **Base grants**, available to participating candidates who meet qualifying thresholds, sufficient to run a viable campaign in the relevant media market and district or State.

#### (d) Funding source.
Public financing under this section shall be paid from a Democracy Trust Fund established in the Treasury, funded by—

1. civil penalties collected for violations of Federal election law;
2. assessments on large political expenditures and certain high-dollar political advertising buys, as specified by the Commission;
3. appropriations as necessary to ensure adequate funding for the program.

#### (e) Protections against circumvention.
The Commission shall promulgate rules to prevent circumvention of the program through coordinated expenditures, affiliated entities, straw donors, pass-through organizations, and sham issue ads.

---

### SEC. 7. REASONABLE LIMITS ON ELECTION-RELATED SPENDING; ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-DOMINATION MEASURES.

#### (a) Contribution limits.
The Commission shall establish and enforce strict limits on contributions to candidates, political committees, and other entities engaged in election-related spending, including aggregate and anti-circumvention limits.

#### (b) Independent expenditures by artificial entities.
No corporation, labor organization, or other artificial entity may make independent expenditures, electioneering communications, or disbursements for the purpose of influencing a covered election, directly or through intermediaries.

#### (c) Coordination.
Any spending that is coordinated, in fact or in effect, with a candidate or the candidate’s agents shall be treated as a contribution to that candidate and subject to the strictest applicable limits and prohibitions.

#### (d) Disclaimer and transparency.
The Commission shall require clear disclaimers on political advertising and robust disclosure of true, beneficial sources of funds, including through look-through rules for pass-through entities.

---

### SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT; RULEMAKING; AUDITS.

#### (a) Rulemaking.
Not later than 180 days after enactment, the Commission shall promulgate regulations necessary to carry out this Act.

#### (b) Enforcement.
The Commission shall have authority to investigate, audit, subpoena, and impose civil penalties for violations, including enhanced penalties for knowing and willful violations.

#### (c) Private right of action.
Any candidate participating in the public financing program, or any eligible voter residing in the jurisdiction of a covered election, may bring a civil action to enforce compliance where the Commission fails to act within statutory timelines, subject to procedures established by the Commission.

---

### SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof, is held invalid, the remainder of this Act, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected.

---

### SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year beginning not less than 180 days after the date of enactment, except that the Commission may take such actions prior to that date as are necessary to carry out this Act.
