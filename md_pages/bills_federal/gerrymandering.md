# 119th CONGRESS  
## 2d Session  
### H. R. ____  

**To require States to create congressional districts using an open, reproducible, geometry-based method; to prohibit partisan and incumbent favoritism in congressional redistricting; to require transparency and statistical outlier testing; to prevent deadlock by providing automatic adoption rules; and for other purposes.**

## IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Mr./Ms. __________________ introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on __________________

---

# A BILL  
## To be entitled  
### The “Geometric Fair Congressional Districts Act of 2026”.

---

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the **“Geometric Fair Congressional Districts Act of 2026.”**

---

## SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

### (a) Findings.
Congress finds the following:

1. Article I, section 4 of the Constitution grants Congress authority to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections for Representatives.  
2. The legitimacy of representative government depends on congressional districts that are compact, contiguous, population-balanced, and compliant with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  
3. Partisan and incumbent-driven redistricting undermines equal representation and public trust.  
4. Redistricting processes that rely on bipartisan bargaining or multi-member committees can fail to timely produce maps, leading to delay, litigation, or court-imposed plans.  
5. Modern public mapping tools and open-source methods allow congressional districts to be created through **reproducible, publicly auditable, geometry-based computation** using neutral criteria and without partisan data.

### (b) Purposes.
The purposes of this Act are:

1. To mandate a **non-discretionary, geometry-first, algorithmic method** for congressional redistricting that does not depend on political negotiation.  
2. To prohibit the use of partisan, incumbent, or candidate data in the construction of congressional districts.  
3. To require transparency, reproducibility, and objective testing (including ensemble outlier analysis) before any congressional map may take effect.  
4. To prevent deadlock and delay by providing **automatic adoption** and ranked fallback procedures.

# TITLE I — DEFINITIONS

## SEC. 101. DEFINITIONS.
In this Act:

1. **“State”** means each State of the United States.  
2. **“Covered redistricting”** means the establishment of congressional districts after an apportionment under the decennial census, or any court-ordered redistricting affecting congressional districts.  
3. **“Congressional districting plan”** means a complete set of districts for the election of Representatives in Congress for a State entitled to more than one Representative.  
4. **“Algorithmic Geometric Plan”** means a congressional districting plan produced solely by the Geometry-First Method required by section 301, using only permitted inputs, with no post-generation manual boundary edits.  
5. **“Geometry-First Method”** means the mandated plan-generation process described in section 301.  
6. **“Political data”** means party registration, past election results, partisan indexes, modeled partisanship, incumbents’ addresses, candidates’ addresses, and any data derived from those items.  
7. **“Manual boundary edit”** means any human-directed adjustment that changes which census blocks, voting precincts, or other geographic units are assigned to districts after a candidate plan has been generated by the Geometry-First Method, excluding only (A) clerical corrections that do not change assignments, or (B) correction of an input dataset followed by a complete rerun of the Method.  
8. **“Compactness metrics”** include, at minimum:  
   - (A) **Polsby–Popper compactness**;  
   - (B) **Reock compactness**; and  
   - (C) a graph-based boundary-complexity measure (including a **cut-edges** or equivalent adjacency-boundary metric).  
9. **“Outlier analysis”** means the statistical evaluation described in section 304 comparing a proposed plan to an ensemble of plans generated without political data.

---

# TITLE II — SCOPE AND RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW

## SEC. 201. SCOPE.
1. This Act applies only to **congressional districts for the election of Representatives**.  
2. Nothing in this Act requires or authorizes States to alter districts for State legislatures, local offices, or other bodies.

## SEC. 202. STATES WITH ONE REPRESENTATIVE.
A State entitled to only one Representative is not required to establish congressional districts under this Act.

## SEC. 203. SINGLE-MEMBER DISTRICTS.
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to alter existing federal requirements that Representatives be elected from single-member districts where applicable.

---

# TITLE III — MANDATORY GEOMETRY-FIRST PLAN GENERATION

## SEC. 301. REQUIRED GEOMETRY-FIRST METHOD; NO COMMITTEE LINE-DRAWING.
### (a) Requirement.
For any covered redistricting, each State entitled to more than one Representative shall establish congressional districts only through an **Algorithmic Geometric Plan** produced by the **Geometry-First Method**.

### (b) Full specification; reproducibility.
The Geometry-First Method shall be fully specified by statute or regulation of the State such that any qualified member of the public can reproduce the same outputs using the same inputs and seed.

### (c) Required structure of the Method.
The Method shall include:

1. A deterministic process or publicly seeded stochastic process;  
2. A geometry-first initial partitioning step, including a splitline-style or shortest-boundary partitioning approach; and  
3. An optimization and selection step that chooses plans strictly by the scoring and constraints in this Act.

### (d) Prohibition on manual line-drawing.
No State legislature, commission, agency, or other entity may adopt, amend, or modify district boundaries by Manual boundary edit. If a legal defect is identified, the only permitted remedy is a rerun as described in section 306 or adoption of a published fallback plan.

---

## SEC. 302. PERMITTED INPUTS; PROHIBITED INPUTS.
### (a) Permitted inputs.
The Method may use only:

1. Decennial census population data and official geographic boundary files;  
2. Adjacency/topology information needed to ensure contiguity;  
3. Political subdivision boundaries (counties, municipalities, and precincts) as neutral constraints; and  
4. Data necessary to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

### (b) Prohibited inputs.
Political data shall not be used in constructing any plan.

### (c) Limited evaluation use.
Political data may be used only for:

1. Voting Rights Act compliance evaluation where required by law; and  
2. The outlier analysis in section 304, provided it is not used to modify a plan to advantage a party, incumbent, or candidate.

---

## SEC. 303. MANDATORY DISTRICTING CRITERIA (ORDER OF PRIORITY).
Each Algorithmic Geometric Plan shall satisfy the following, in order:

1. **Federal constitutional compliance**, including equal population requirements for congressional districts;  
2. **Voting Rights Act compliance**;  
3. **Contiguity**, with point contiguity prohibited;  
4. **Compactness**, maximizing compactness metrics defined in section 101(8);  
5. **Minimization of political subdivision splits**, minimizing county and municipality splits subject to paragraphs (1)–(3);  
6. **Neutrality**, prohibiting intent or effect of favoring or disfavoring a political party, incumbent, or candidate.

---

## SEC. 304. REQUIRED ENSEMBLE OUTLIER ANALYSIS.
### (a) Requirement.
Before any congressional districting plan may take effect, the State shall obtain an outlier analysis performed by a qualified independent institution with demonstrated redistricting expertise.

### (b) Ensemble generation.
The outlier analysis shall:

1. Generate an ensemble of not fewer than 1,000 alternative plans that satisfy section 303 and that use no political data in construction;  
2. Compare the State’s Selected Plan to the ensemble on:  
   - (A) compactness and subdivision-splits measures; and  
   - (B) partisan outcome measures (using political data only at the evaluation stage).

### (c) Extreme outlier restriction.
If the Selected Plan is an extreme outlier with respect to partisan outcomes (favoring any party), the Selected Plan shall not take effect unless the State demonstrates in written findings that adopting a non-outlier plan would violate section 303(1) or 303(2).

---

## SEC. 305. TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC REPRODUCIBILITY.
For each covered redistricting, the State shall publish on a publicly accessible website:

1. All datasets used (with versioning and citations);  
2. All code used to generate plans and compute scores, under an open license;  
3. All run parameters and random seeds sufficient to reproduce outputs;  
4. The full set of candidate plans considered for adoption (or a representative set not fewer than 1,000, if computationally necessary) with scores;  
5. The outlier analysis report; and  
6. A certification that no political data was used in construction and no Manual boundary edits were performed.

---

# TITLE IV — AUTOMATIC ADOPTION; FALLBACKS; DEADLINE SAFEGUARDS

## SEC. 401. AUTOMATIC SELECTION AND ADOPTION BY OPERATION OF LAW.
### (a) Ranked plan list.
Each State shall generate and publish a ranked list of not fewer than 10 highest-scoring compliant plans (the “Ranked Plan List”).

### (b) Selected Plan.
The highest-ranked plan that passes the outlier restriction in section 304(c) shall be the “Selected Plan”.

### (c) Operation of law.
Upon publication of the Selected Plan and the materials required by section 305, the Selected Plan shall take effect **by operation of law** for congressional elections in that State, without further discretion, amendment, or legislative approval.

---

## SEC. 402. DEADLINES; FAILURE TO ACT.
### (a) Deadline.
Each State shall complete publication under section 305 not later than the date that is 18 months after the release of the State’s redistricting data by the Bureau of the Census, or such earlier date as may be necessary to ensure orderly administration of the next regularly scheduled congressional election.

### (b) Failure to timely publish.
If a State fails to timely publish the Selected Plan as required, the following shall occur:

1. The highest-ranked plan on the Ranked Plan List that has been generated and published shall take effect by operation of law; and  
2. If the State has not generated a Ranked Plan List, a federal court of competent jurisdiction shall, on an expedited basis, appoint a special master to implement the Geometry-First Method using the criteria of this Act.

## SEC. 501. ENFORCEMENT; PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.
1. The Attorney General of the United States may bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce this Act.  
2. Any aggrieved voter in a State may bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce compliance with this Act.

## SEC. 502. EXPEDITED REVIEW.
Any action under this Act shall be heard on an expedited basis. Courts shall provide prompt relief sufficient to ensure timely implementation prior to the next congressional election.

## SEC. 503. REMEDIES.
If a plan is found unlawful:

1. The court shall order the State to cure by rerunning the Geometry-First Method with minimal objective constraints needed for compliance; or  
2. If necessary to meet election deadlines, the court shall order adoption of the highest-ranked published fallback plan that cures the defect.
