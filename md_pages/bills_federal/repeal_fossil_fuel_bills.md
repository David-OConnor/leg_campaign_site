H. R. _____
Fossil Fuel Industry–Drafted Legislation Repeal and Transparency Act of 2026

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr./Ms. ____________________ introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on ____________________.

A BILL

To repeal certain recently enacted measures relating to fossil fuels, to establish a formal process for identifying and repealing enactments substantially drafted by covered fossil fuel entities or their agents, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the “Fossil Fuel Industry–Drafted Legislation Repeal and Transparency Act of 2026”.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) Findings.

Congress finds the following:

Congress has a compelling interest in ensuring that Federal legislation is drafted and enacted in a manner that is transparent to the public and free from undisclosed conflicts of interest.

Regulated entities, trade associations, and lobbyists frequently provide proposed legislative text to Members of Congress and congressional committees.

When proposed legislative text provided by a covered fossil fuel entity (or its agents) is introduced or enacted without meaningful public disclosure, public trust in democratic institutions is harmed.

Recent legislative activity has included measures expanding or accelerating fossil fuel extraction, leasing, and export approvals, and measures nullifying climate- and pollution-related rules, including:

Public Law 119–21 (H.R. 1), enacted July 4, 2025, which includes provisions mandating offshore oil and gas lease sales through 2040.

Public Law 119–2 (H.J. Res. 35), enacted March 14, 2025, which nullified an EPA rule regarding “Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems”.

+1

Public Law 119–51 (H.J. Res. 130), enacted December 11, 2025, which disapproved a Bureau of Land Management rule relating to the Buffalo Field Office resource management plan amendment affecting coal leasing.

Public Law 119–52 (H.J. Res. 131), enacted December 11, 2025, which disapproved a Bureau of Land Management rule relating to the “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision”.

(b) Purpose.

The purposes of this Act are—

to repeal specified recent enactments and restore a baseline of environmental and public-interest protections;

to establish an evidence-based process to identify Federal enactments during the prior year that were substantially drafted by covered fossil fuel entities or their agents; and

to require robust disclosure of industry-drafted legislative text and drafting assistance for future legislation.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

Covered fossil fuel entity means—

(A) any corporation or other entity primarily engaged in the extraction, production, processing, transportation, refining, marketing, or export of coal, crude oil, petroleum products, or natural gas; and

(B) any trade association, advocacy organization, or coalition that primarily represents entities described in subparagraph (A).

Agent means any lobbyist, law firm, consulting firm, public relations firm, contractor, or other person acting on behalf of a covered fossil fuel entity.

Lookback period means the 1-year period ending on the date of enactment of this Act.

Covered enactment means any Act, joint resolution, or provision of Federal law enacted during the lookback period.

Substantially drafted means that, with respect to a covered enactment (or discrete provision), the Comptroller General determines, based on documentary evidence, that—

(A) a covered fossil fuel entity or agent supplied proposed legislative text that is materially identical or substantially similar in meaning and structure to enacted text; and

(B) such supplied text constituted a meaningful portion of the enacted text, as defined by standards established under section 4(b).

SEC. 4. GAO REVIEW AND DETERMINATION OF INDUSTRY-DRAFTED ENACTMENTS.
(a) Review required.

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall complete a review of covered enactments enacted during the lookback period to identify any covered enactment (or discrete provision) that was substantially drafted by a covered fossil fuel entity or agent.

(b) Standards and methodology.

Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall publish standards describing—

how “materially identical” and “substantially similar” will be evaluated (including text-comparison methods);

the threshold for “meaningful portion” (which may vary by the length and structure of the covered enactment); and

the forms of documentary evidence that may be used, including drafts, emails, attachments, redlines, meeting notes, submissions to committees, and other records lawfully obtained.

(c) Report and public list.

The Comptroller General shall submit to Congress and make publicly available a report that includes—

a list of each covered enactment (and, where applicable, each discrete provision) determined to be substantially drafted;

a description of the evidentiary basis for each determination, with appropriate redactions for legally protected information; and

recommendations for legislative drafting transparency best practices.

SEC. 5. REPEAL OF SPECIFIED RECENT ENACTMENTS.
(a) Repeals.

The following are hereby repealed:

Public Law 119–2 (H.J. Res. 35; “Providing for congressional disapproval … of the EPA rule titled Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems …”).

(b) Conforming restoration.

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with applicable law, take such actions as are necessary to restore the legal effect of rules and determinations nullified by the laws repealed under subsection (a), including reissuance where required.

(c) Rule of construction.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of an agency to revise, update, or replace any restored rule through lawful notice-and-comment rulemaking.

SEC. 6. AUTOMATIC REPEAL OF INDUSTRY-DRAFTED ENACTMENTS IDENTIFIED BY GAO.
(a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (b), any covered enactment (or discrete provision) identified by the Comptroller General under section 4 as substantially drafted is hereby repealed, effective on the date that is 30 days after the Comptroller General makes the report under section 4(c) publicly available.

(b) Exception for subsequent affirmative reauthorization.

A covered enactment (or discrete provision) described in subsection (a) shall not be repealed (or shall be deemed reinstated, as applicable) if Congress enacts, after the date of the GAO report, a law that expressly reauthorizes that enactment or provision.

SEC. 7. PROSPECTIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING ASSISTANCE.
(a) Disclosure statement requirement.

It shall be a requirement of House and Senate rules (and is hereby enacted as a standing order for the remainder of the 119th Congress and subsequent Congresses unless superseded) that any introduced bill or joint resolution include a disclosure statement, to the extent practicable, identifying whether any covered fossil fuel entity or agent provided draft text or drafting assistance that was incorporated in whole or in part.

(b) Public posting of submitted draft text.

When a Member of Congress, committee, or staff receives draft legislative text from a covered fossil fuel entity or agent intended for inclusion in legislation, the receiving office shall, not later than 7 days after receipt, post such draft text in a publicly accessible repository maintained by the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate, except where prohibited by law.

(c) Enforcement.

House and Senate rules shall provide that legislation lacking the disclosure statement required under subsection (a) may not be considered on the floor unless the disclosure statement is filed prior to consideration.

SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of a provision of this Act to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this Act, and the application of the provisions to any other person or circumstance, shall not be affected.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment, except as otherwise provided.

Non-legislative note (for context; not part of the bill text)

If you want, I can revise the “specified recent enactments” list in section 5 to be only the fossil-fuel-related titles/sections within Public Law 119–21 (H.R. 1) instead of leaving that to the GAO-driven process—Public Law 119–21 is very broad, so targeted repeals are often cleaner.
