# Simpler, fairer taxes

Simplify the tax code: No payoffs or incentives for politically-connected industries.
Taxes should be easy enough for all to understand.

Stop listening to tax-prep industry: They exist to make money off this process which hurts taxpayers.

End corporate tax loopholes. The wealthy should not benefit off the backs of everyone else.
