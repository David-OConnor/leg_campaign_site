# Community feedback on legislation

I  write pre-print legislation, and share it with the public to get feedback. As a representative and public servant, I want the electorate to play an active part in the legislature process.

I want you to know, even if I'm not elected, exactly what legislation I will submit, and I want your input on it.

See the living [list of proposals]() for details.
