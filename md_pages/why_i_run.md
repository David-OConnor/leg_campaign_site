# Why am I running for Congress?

Even if I don't win, my candidacy will shift focus on the foundational issues that serve the people.

What I will do: Always fight for . I'm not fighting for corporate interests, and not fighting to look good on the hot-button topics aimed to divide us. I'm not fighting for the billionaire class. I will not distract with identity politics, nor . We deserve better than that.


I'm here to pit American against American, nor create enemies out of convenience. What we share dwarfs what we differ on, so let's focus on that.

What I will:
What I won't: Scapegoat certain groups of people.


## Long-term thinking
I'm going to fight build a better tomorrow, for our children, and a better today for ordinary Americans of all political backgrounds, urban, suburban, and rural.


## Direct communications
I refuse to modulate my communications in order play games or win points. I mean everything I say, and will never dumb down my message, lie, or tell half-truths. I respect my fellow Americans, and will treat you with the empathy and respect you deserve. 


## Honesty and integrity
