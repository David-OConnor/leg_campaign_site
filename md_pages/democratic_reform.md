# Democratic reform

A fair election system is key to a healthy democracy, and is the foundation of government. Our current system favors incumbants and well-funded interest groups, at the expense of fair representation, and interests of the people.


## Districts
There is no conscionable justification for our Gerrymandered districts - they're embarrassing, and the origin of problems which propogate through government. Failling to reform them is unethical. Even if a given district shape means a *win* for the party you support, it's an affront to a healthy government.

We cannot allow those elected, or anyone with a conflict of interest to determine districts. This is an unfair system with misaligned incentives. I support legislation to build fair, impartial districts - not ones selected to benefit specific parties or candidates.

This is a truly bipartisan problem, and shows that we’re serious about democracy, and fighting corruption.


### Legislation
When elected, I will fight for fair districts, and continue to draft and promote legislation that provides a practical path forwar. I support NC [HR20: Establishing the Select Committee on Electoral Reform]((https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/20/text?s=1&r=5&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22election+reform%22%7D))

Fix our districts. Gerrymandered districts run counter to the most basic principles of democracy.  Fix them: There is no valid justification for keeping them.

We don’t need a perfect solution, and there are many viable options. I propose ____, but would support any system that removes conflicts of interest from districting. Fair maps mean politicians are truly representatives of the people, instead of their own interests.


### Judicial code of ethics
I support depoliticizing the Supreme Court. It's currently tied too heavily to the President who appoints each justice. I support increasing the number of Supreme court seats, and implementing a term limit for Justices. Appointments will be spread evenly between presidential terms.

I support enforcing a code of ethics for Supreme Court justices, focused on ensuring Justices remain impartial and make bribes non-viable.
