# Funding for science

I support funding basic research - without a requirement for short-term payoffs, and without 
wasting researcher's times on competing for grants in a 0-sum game.


## A role model, as we were
We will regain our status as a role model for scientific research; attracting top talent 
from around the world, and nurturing science in our children.
