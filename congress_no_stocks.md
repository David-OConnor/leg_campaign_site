# SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

# SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

## (a) Findings.

Congress finds the following:

1. Members of Congress hold positions of public trust and exercise substantial influence over Federal lawmaking, oversight, appropriations, taxation, and regulation that may affect financial markets and specific issuers.
2. Permitting Members of Congress to purchase or sell individual stocks while serving creates unavoidable conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, that can undermine public confidence in democratic institutions.
3. No set of disclosures or enforcement mechanisms can fully eliminate the conflict between personal financial gain from trading and the duty to act impartially in the public interest.

## (b) Purpose.

The purpose of this Act is to prevent conflicts of interest and restore public confidence by prohibiting Members of Congress and certain covered persons from purchasing or selling individual stocks and other covered financial instruments while the Member serves in Congress.
